# Cursor Design Rules for Docs

rules:

  - name: Headings
    description: Use a consistent heading hierarchy for clarity
    content: |
      • Use H1 only once at the top of each page (the page title).
      • Use H2 for major sections (e.g., Tools, AI Employees, Quickstart).
      • Use H3 for subsections inside Tools/Concepts.
      • Do not skip heading levels (H2 → H4 without H3).
      • Keep headings short, 2–5 words max.

  - name: Paragraphs
    description: Enforce minimalistic prose style
    content: |
      • Use short paragraphs (2–4 sentences).
      • Avoid marketing or hype adjectives.
      • Write in neutral, instructional tone.

  - name: Lists
    description: Ensure uniform bullet styling
    content: |
      • Use unordered bullets (– or •) for lists of features or items.
      • Use ordered lists (1., 2., 3.) only for step-by-step instructions.
      • Do not mix list styles in one section.

  - name: Examples
    description: Show prompts and outputs cleanly
    content: |
      • Place all natural language prompts in fenced code blocks with "text" syntax.
      • Always prefix with a line like “**Example prompt**” before the block.
      • Do not put prompts inline with normal text.

  - name: Images
    description: Standardize image placement
    content: |
      • Place images immediately after the related text or example.
      • Use captions in italics beneath the image: *Image: Kafka on LinkedIn*
      • Do not embed decorative images; only functional examples.

  - name: Crosslinks
    description: Make navigation look like Cursor’s docs
    content: |
      • Use inline markdown links for related pages (e.g., [Tools](../tools)).
      • Always provide a “Learn more” link at the end of a section if more detail exists.

  - name: Spacing
    description: Keep consistent whitespace
    content: |
      • Always leave one blank line before and after headings.
      • Leave one blank line before and after images.
      • Do not leave trailing blank lines at the end of a section.

  - name: Tables
    description: Use clean markdown tables when comparing features
    content: |
      • Use tables for structured comparisons (e.g., Tool vs Function).
      • Avoid inline HTML styling.
      • Keep column count ≤ 3 for readability.

  - name: Notes
    description: Style callouts consistently
    content: |
      • Format callouts as blockquotes starting with "Note:" or "Tip:".
      • Example: 
        > **Note:** Kafka currently supports Slack and Email as access points.
