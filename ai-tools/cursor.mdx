## Available Connections

**Email**
Send tasks and requests via email. Kafka responds in threaded conversations.

**Phone Number**
Get a dedicated phone number for voice communication with Kafka.

**Slack** (Recommended)
Connect Kafka to your Slack workspace for seamless team collaboration.

## Using Slack

Slack is the most popular way to interact with Kafka. Once connected, anyone in your workspace can message Kafka directly.

**How it works:**
1. Add Kafka to a Slack channel (e.g., `#demo-kafka`)
2. Message Kafka directly: `@demo-kafka summarize my emails`
3. Kafka responds in the thread with results

Anyone with access to the channel can interact with Kafka, making it perfect for team-wide AI Employee access.

## FAQs

**Can anyone message the agent on Slack?**

Yes, anyone with access to the channel that the agent is in can message the agent.

**How do I send a message to Kafka via Email?**

Send an email to your Kafka's dedicated email address (found in **My Kafka → Connection**). Kafka will respond via email thread.

**Can I limit who has access to my Kafka?**

Yes. For Slack, only users in channels where Kafka is added can interact with it. Use private channels for restricted access.

**Does Kafka remember previous conversations?**

Yes. Kafka maintains context within each thread. Start a new thread for unrelated topics.

**Can I use multiple connection types at once?**

Yes. You can enable Email, Phone, and Slack simultaneously. Kafka maintains separate conversation threads for each channel.

**What happens if multiple people message Kafka at the same time?**

Kafka handles concurrent requests. Each conversation thread operates independently.

**How do I remove Kafka from a Slack channel?**

Go to the channel, click the channel name, select "Integrations," and remove the Kafka app.
