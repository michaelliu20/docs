Best practices for deploying and using Kafka effectively in your organization.

## Start Small, Scale Gradually

**Begin with one use case**

Don't try to automate everything at once. Pick one high-value, repetitive task and build a single AI Employee around it.

Good first use cases:
- Daily email summaries
- Candidate pipeline updates
- Task syncing between tools

**Expand after validation**

Once your first AI Employee proves valuable, add more workflows and playbooks. Then consider creating additional AI Employees for different roles.

## Define Clear Boundaries

**Set explicit escalation rules**

In Global Instructions, specify exactly when Kafka should ask for human input vs. proceeding autonomously.

```text
Escalate to me if:
- Financial decisions over $500
- Candidate has competing offers
- Project timeline changes by more than 1 week
```

**Use activation criteria thoughtfully**

Make playbook triggers specific enough to activate when needed, but not so broad they fire constantly.

## Iterate Based on Real Use

**Deploy, observe, refine**

Treat your AI Employee as a living system:
1. Deploy in real work scenarios
2. Monitor how Kafka performs
3. Adjust Global Instructions, Workflows, and Playbooks
4. Repeat weekly

**Track what works**

Keep notes on:
- Which workflows save the most time
- Which playbooks get used most often
- Where Kafka struggles or needs clarification

## Give Kafka Context

**Be specific in instructions**

Bad: "Check my calendar"
Good: "Check my @google-calendar for conflicts between 2-4pm tomorrow"

Bad: "Find candidates"
Good: "Use @apollo to find 10 software engineers in San Francisco with 5+ years React experience"

**Provide examples**

In Global Instructions and Playbooks, show Kafka what good output looks like.

```text
When summarizing emails, format like this:
• [Sender] - [Topic] - [Action needed]
• John Smith - Q4 Budget - Needs approval by Friday
```

## Use the Right Tool for the Job

**Workflows** → Fully autonomous, recurring tasks
- Daily summaries
- Scheduled reports
- Event-driven notifications

**Playbooks** → Semi-structured tasks needing consistency
- Standard procedures
- Quality-controlled processes
- Repeatable formats

**Direct conversation** → One-off requests
- Ad-hoc questions
- Non-repeatable tasks
- Exploratory work

## Enable Team Adoption

**Add Kafka to relevant Slack channels**

Put Kafka where the work happens. If your team discusses recruiting in `#hiring`, add your Recruiter AI Employee there.

**Document your AI Employees**

Keep a simple doc explaining:
- What each AI Employee does
- How to interact with it
- When to use workflows vs. asking directly
- Escalation protocols

**Gather team feedback**

Your team will discover edge cases and improvement opportunities. Create a channel for feedback.

## Security & Privacy

**Grant minimum necessary permissions**

When connecting integrations, give Kafka only the access it needs for its specific role.

**Review sensitive data handling**

In Global Instructions, specify how Kafka should handle:
- Confidential information
- Personal data
- Financial information
- Customer data

**Use private channels for sensitive work**

For AI Employees handling confidential information, use private Slack channels with restricted access.

## Measure Impact

Track these metrics:
- **Time saved** — Hours per week your team gains back
- **Tasks automated** — Number of manual tasks Kafka handles
- **Response time** — How quickly Kafka completes requests
- **Error rate** — How often Kafka needs correction

Adjust your approach based on what delivers the most value.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**Over-automating too quickly**

Don't automate complex processes before validating simple ones.

**Vague instructions**

"Handle my email" won't work well. "Scan @gmail daily at 9am for emails from clients and summarize urgent ones" will.

**Ignoring feedback loops**

If Kafka makes the same mistake repeatedly, update Global Instructions or the relevant Playbook.

**Forgetting to update integrations**

As your stack changes, keep Kafka's connected tools current.
