## Tab

The Tab is your primary interface for interacting with Kafka. Each tab represents a separate conversation thread where you can give instructions, receive responses, and monitor ongoing tasks.

### Key Features
- **Persistent conversations**: Each tab maintains context across multiple interactions
- **Real-time updates**: See live progress updates as Kafka works on your tasks
- **Multi-threading**: Work on multiple projects simultaneously across different tabs

## Agent

Kafka operates as an intelligent agent that can understand context, make decisions, and execute complex workflows autonomously. Unlike simple chatbots, Kafka maintains awareness of your business processes and can take meaningful actions.

### Agent Capabilities
- **Natural language understanding**: Interprets complex instructions in plain English
- **Context awareness**: Remembers previous interactions and maintains project context
- **Decision making**: Can make autonomous decisions within defined parameters
- **Tool orchestration**: Coordinates multiple tools and systems to complete tasks

## Background Agent

When working on long-running tasks, Kafka operates as a background agent, continuing work even when you're not actively monitoring the conversation.

### Background Processing
- **Autonomous execution**: Continues working on tasks without constant supervision
- **Progress reporting**: Provides regular updates on task completion status
- **Error handling**: Identifies and resolves issues independently when possible
- **Notification system**: Alerts you when tasks are complete or require attention

## Workflows

Workflows define the automated processes that Kafka can execute. They combine multiple steps, tools, and decision points into cohesive automation sequences.

### Workflow Components
- **Triggers**: Events or conditions that start a workflow
- **Actions**: Individual steps Kafka performs
- **Conditions**: Logic that determines the next steps
- **Integrations**: Connections to external tools and systems

## Playbooks

Playbooks are standardized procedures that guide Kafka's responses to common scenarios. They ensure consistent handling of recurring situations.

### Playbook Structure
- **Scenario identification**: Conditions that trigger the playbook
- **Step-by-step procedures**: Clear instructions for handling the situation
- **Decision trees**: Logic for handling variations and edge cases
- **Success criteria**: How to determine when the task is complete

## Global Instructions

Global Instructions provide overarching rules and context that Kafka follows across all interactions, ensuring consistent behavior aligned with your organization's standards.

### Instruction Types
- **Behavioral guidelines**: How Kafka should communicate and operate
- **Security policies**: Data handling and access restrictions
- **Business rules**: Company-specific procedures and constraints
- **Compliance requirements**: Regulatory and legal guidelines
