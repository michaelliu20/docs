Global Instructions define your AI Employee's role, personality, and foundational rules. They're included in every conversation Kafka has.

## What Global Instructions Include

**Job Description**
Define what your AI Employee does and its primary responsibilities.

```text
You are my AI Executive Assistant. Manage my calendar, email, and daily tasks.
```

**Integrations**
List which tools your AI Employee has access to.

```text
You have access to: @gmail, @google-calendar, @slack
```

**Context & Rules**
Provide important context Kafka should always know.

```text
I work in Pacific Time. I prefer brief, actionable summaries. Never schedule meetings before 9am or after 5pm.
```

**Tone & Style**
Define how Kafka should communicate.

```text
Be professional but friendly. Use bullet points for lists. Keep responses concise.
```

**Escalation Rules**
Specify when Kafka should ask for human input.

```text
Escalate any financial decisions over $1,000. Defer to me for strategic planning decisions.
```

## Example Global Instructions

```text
You are my AI Recruiter.

You have access to: @apollo, @greenhouse

I'm hiring for software engineering roles in San Francisco. Our company values 
collaboration and technical excellence. Never send outreach before I approve the message.

Be professional and conversational in all communications. Keep candidate interactions 
warm but efficient.

Escalate to me if: candidate has competing offers, salary expectations exceed budget, 
or candidate requests to speak with founder.
```

## Best Practices

**Be specific about role and boundaries**
Clearly define what your AI Employee should and shouldn't do.

**Include relevant context**
Add company info, working hours, preferences, and constraints that apply to all tasks.

**Set clear escalation rules**
Define when Kafka should ask for human input vs. proceeding autonomously.

**Keep it concise**
Global Instructions should fit in 1-2 paragraphs. Use Playbooks for detailed procedures.

**Update as you learn**
Refine Global Instructions based on how Kafka performs in real use.

## Tips

- **Test changes incrementally** — Update one section at a time and observe the impact
- **Use examples** — "Respond like: [example]" is clearer than "Be professional"
- **Specify tools** — List integrations so Kafka knows what's available
- **Set working hours** — Prevent off-hours actions if needed

Global Instructions are the foundation of your AI Employee. The clearer they are, the better Kafka performs.
