## How Integrations Work

Kafka uses **Pipedream** to power integrations. When you connect an integration using OAuth, Kafka acts as you — gaining the same access and permissions you have in that tool.

This means:
- Kafka can read your emails in Gmail
- Create tasks in ClickUp under your account
- Send Slack messages as you
- Search for candidates in Apollo with your credentials

Once connected, reference integrations in workflows, playbooks, and conversations using the `@` symbol:

```text
@gmail — Access your email
@slack — Send messages and read channels
@clickup — Create and manage tasks
@apollo — Search for people and companies
```

Kafka automatically uses the appropriate integration based on your instructions.

## Example Usage

**In a Workflow:**
```yaml
name: Daily Task Sync
trigger: daily at 5 pm

Content:
1. Scan through @slack for any new action items
2. Create tasks in @clickup with proper assignments
3. Send confirmation in @slack thread
```

**In a Playbook:**
```yaml
name: Schedule Interview
activation_criteria: When candidate passes initial screen

Instructions:
1. Check availability in @google-calendar
2. Send meeting invite via @gmail
3. Update candidate status in @greenhouse
4. Notify hiring manager in @slack
```

**In Conversation:**
```text
"Pull my last 50 emails from @gmail and summarize them"
"Add this to @clickup as a high-priority task"
"Search @apollo for software engineers in San Francisco"
```

## Best Practices

**Connect only what you need**
Start with 2-3 core integrations. Add more as your use cases expand.

**Use consistent naming**
Always use `@integration` format to reference tools in workflows and playbooks.

**Set proper permissions**
Grant Kafka only the access it needs for its specific tasks.

**Test integrations**
Verify connections work before building complex workflows that depend on them.

**Monitor usage**
Check integration logs to ensure Kafka is using tools correctly.

## Adding Integrations

1. Go to **My Kafka → Integrations**
2. Search for the tool you want to connect
3. Click to authenticate and grant permissions
4. Reference with `@toolname` in workflows and playbooks

New integrations are added regularly. Contact support if you need a specific tool that's not yet available.
