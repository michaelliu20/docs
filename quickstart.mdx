# Creating Your First AI Employee with Kafka

This quickstart will walk you through creating your first AI Employee using Kafka's core features. By the end, you'll understand how to set up Workflows, Playbooks, Integrations, and Tools to power your employee.

## Step 1: Choose Your AI Employee Template

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="AI Executive Assistant" icon="briefcase" defaultOpen>
    An AI Employee that manages your inbox, calendar, and communications.
    
    **You'll learn to build:**
    - Daily email summary with phone call workflow (9am trigger)
    - Professional email formatting playbook
    - Gmail and Google Calendar integrations
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="AI Recruiter" icon="users">
    An AI Employee that finds candidates and tracks your recruiting pipeline.
    
    **You'll learn to build:**
    - Daily candidate outreach workflow (10am trigger)
    - Recruiting pipeline update playbook
    - Apollo and Greenhouse integrations
  </Accordion>

## Step 2: Open Your Employee Home Page

Navigate to your Kafka Employee Home Page. This is your control center for building, customizing, and managing your AI Employee.

/>

## Step 3: Define Kafka's Role with Global Instructions

The Global Instructions are where you set your AI Employee's personality, boundaries, and always-on knowledge.

Go to: **My Kafka → Global Instructions**

<img
  src="/images/Kafka Global Instructions.png"
  alt="Kafka Global Instructions Template"
  className="rounded-lg border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-800"
/>

Fill out the pre-made template to define your employee's mission, style, and constraints.

**Examples:**

<div className="ml-6">

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Executive Assistant">
```text
You are my AI Executive Assistant. 

Always respond politely and concisely. 

Prioritize my calendar, task deadlines, and external communications. 

Defer to human input for financial approvals.
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Recruiter">
```text
You are my AI Recruiter. 

Screen candidates based on job requirements and schedule interviews automatically.

Maintain a professional tone. 

Always verify candidate details before proceeding with outreach.
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Project Manager">
```text
You are my AI Project Manager. 

Track project timelines, coordinate team tasks, and flag potential delays. 

Maintain clear communication with stakeholders. 

Escalate critical blockers immediately.
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

</div>

This ensures your Kafka Employee consistently operates with the right framing.

## Step 4: Add Integrations

Integrations connect your Kafka Employee with the tools and data sources it needs.

Go to: **My Kafka → Integrations**

<img
  src="/images/Integrations.gif"
  alt="Kafka Integrations Panel"
  className="rounded-lg border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-800"
/>

Connect the integrations your AI Employee needs:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Executive Assistant">
    - **Gmail** — for email scanning and management
    - **Google Calendar** — for scheduling and meeting coordination
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Recruiter">
    - **Apollo** — for people and company search
    - **Greenhouse** — for ATS data
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Project Manager">
    - **Slack** — for scanning messages and team communication
    - **ClickUp or Linear** — for task and project management
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Use `@[integration]` to reference integrations from within workflows and playbooks.

## Step 5: Deploy to Slack (Optional)

Connect Kafka to Slack so your team can interact with your AI Employee directly in your workspace.

> **Note:** Deploying to Slack requires upgrading to the $25 Starter plan.

Go to: **My Kafka → Connection**

<img
  src="/images/Slack My Kafka.png"
  alt="Kafka Slack Connection"
  className="rounded-lg border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-800"
/>

Add Slack as a connection method to enable:
- Direct messaging with Kafka in Slack
- Channel mentions and interactions
- Real-time notifications and updates
- Team collaboration with your AI Employee

<img
  src="/images/slack message.gif"
  alt="Messaging Kafka in Slack"
  className="rounded-lg border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-800"
/>

## Step 6: Build Workflows

Workflows run on a trigger, which can be:

- **App-based** — triggered by events in connected tools (e.g., new email, calendar event)
- **Time-based** — triggered on a schedule (e.g., daily at 9am, weekly on Monday)
- **Webhook-based** — triggered by external API calls

<img
  src="/images/Workflow Editing.gif"
  alt="Kafka Workflows Interface"
  className="rounded-lg border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-800"
/>

Once triggered, Kafka performs a set of instructions you define, executing actions autonomously without manual intervention.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Executive Assistant">
    ```yaml
    name: Daily Inbox Call
    trigger: daily at 9 am
    
    Content:
    1. Scan through my email using @gmail for all emails in the last day
    2. Summarize everything and the most important ones to call
    3. Call me at [number], informing me of everything.
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Recruiter">
    ```yaml
    name: Daily Candidate Outreach
    trigger: daily at 10 am
    
    Content:
    1. Use @apollo to find people matching [profile]
    2. Send them an outreach message
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Project Manager">
    ```yaml
    name: Daily Task Sync
    trigger: daily at 5 pm
    
    Content:
    1. Scan through Slack to search for any new items to add to our project management software
    2. Add it to @linear or @clickup
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 7: Create Playbooks

Playbooks are structured guides that Kafka follows for repeated, semi-structured tasks. They're otherwise known as SOPs (standard operating procedures).

Every playbook has an **Activation Criteria** — a situation that, when encountered, prompts Kafka to use the playbook. Playbooks can also be explicitly requested by name or by using `@` inside text editors.

<img
  src="/images/Playbook Usage.gif"
  alt="Using a playbook in Kafka"
  className="rounded-lg border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-800"
/>

**Examples:**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Executive Assistant">
    ```yaml
    name: Structure Professional Email
    activation_criteria: When drafting an external email to executives or clients
    
    Format:
    1. Subject: Clear and action-oriented (5-8 words max)
    2. Greeting: Use "Hi [First Name]," for warm contacts, "Hello [Full Name]," for formal
    3. Opening: State purpose in first sentence
    4. Body: Use bullet points for multiple items, keep paragraphs to 2-3 sentences
    5. Closing: Include clear next steps or call-to-action
    6. Signature: Use professional signature with title and contact info
    
    Tools: @gmail, @google-calendar
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Recruiter">
    ```yaml
    name: Daily Recruiting Pipeline Update
    activation_criteria: When asked for pipeline status or daily recruiting summary
    
    Content:
    1. Pull data from @greenhouse for all active requisitions
    2. Summarize by role:
       - Total candidates in pipeline
       - Candidates by stage (Sourced, Screening, Interview, Offer)
       - Candidates moved forward in last 24 hours
       - Candidates rejected in last 24 hours
    3. Flag roles with <5 candidates in pipeline
    4. Highlight any offers extended or accepted
    5. Format as bulleted summary and send via Slack to #recruiting
    
    Tools: @apollo, @greenhouse
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Project Manager">
    ```yaml
    name: Add Task to ClickUp
    activation_criteria: When a new task or action item is identified in Slack or meetings
    
    Instructions:
    1. Extract task details from context
    2. Create task in @clickup with:
       - Name: [Clear, action-oriented task title]
       - Description: [Context and requirements]
       - Assignee: [Team member mentioned or default to PM]
       - Due Date: [Extract from context or ask if unclear]
       - Priority: [Urgent/High/Normal/Low based on context]
       - Tags: [Project name, task type]
       - List: [Appropriate project list or "Backlog" if unclear]
    3. Confirm task created and share ClickUp link in original thread
    
    Tools: @slack, @clickup, @linear
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 8: Test and Refine

Once your Kafka Employee is live, treat Playbooks and Workflows as living documents that need constant iteration.

The best approach:

1. **Deploy in real use** — Start using your AI Employee in actual work scenarios
2. **Observe and collect feedback** — Notice where Kafka struggles or excels
3. **Refine instructions** — Adjust Global Instructions, Workflows, and Playbooks based on real performance
4. **Iterate continuously** — Your AI Employee improves with each refinement

Don't expect perfection on the first try. The most effective AI Employees are refined over weeks of real-world use.
