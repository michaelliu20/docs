Tools are specialized capabilities that Kafka uses to perform actions across systems.

## Available Tools

Kafka has access to a comprehensive set of tools that enable it to complete real-world tasks:

### Research & Data
- **People Search** — Find and research individuals based on criteria
- **Company Search** — Look up company information and data
- **Web Crawl / Web Scrape** — Extract data from websites

### Communication
- **Phone Call** — Initiate and handle phone conversations
- **Email** — Send, read, and manage email communications

### Automation
- **Browser** — Navigate and interact with web applications
- **Playwright Script** — Run automated browser workflows
- **Code** — Write and execute code for custom tasks

### Advanced Capabilities
- **Sub Agent** — Deploy specialized helper agents for complex tasks
- **API** — Make calls to external APIs and services

## How Tools Work

When you give Kafka an instruction, it automatically selects and uses the appropriate tools to complete the task end-to-end.

**Examples:**
- "Find 10 software engineers in San Francisco" → Uses **People Search**
- "Message this candidate on LinkedIn" → Uses **Browser** automation
- "Call the nearest pizza shop and order a large pepperoni" → Uses **Phone Call**
- "Scrape all pricing from competitor websites" → Uses **Web Scrape**

Tools can be explicitly referenced in Workflows and Playbooks using their names.
