Workflows are automated sequences that Kafka executes autonomously when triggered by an event.

## How Workflows Work

Every workflow has two parts:

1. **Trigger** — What starts the workflow (time-based, app-based, or webhook-based)
2. **Instructions** — What Kafka does once triggered

Once activated, Kafka executes your instructions automatically without manual intervention.

## Trigger Types

**Time-based**
```text
Daily at 9am
Every Monday at 10am
Hourly between 9am-5pm
```

**App-based**
```text
When email arrives in Gmail
When new candidate added to Greenhouse
When Slack message contains keyword
```

**Webhook-based**
```text
When external API call received
When form submitted on website
When payment processed
```

## Example Workflow

```yaml
name: Daily Inbox Call
trigger: daily at 9 am

Content:
1. Scan through my email using @gmail for all emails in the last day
2. Summarize everything and the most important ones to call
3. Call me at [number], informing me of everything.
```

This workflow runs every morning, scans your inbox, and calls you with a summary — completely autonomously.

## Best Practices

**Start simple**
Begin with single-action workflows before building complex multi-step processes.

**Be specific with triggers**
"When email from client@company.com arrives" is better than "When email arrives."

**Test before deploying**
Run workflows manually first to verify they work as expected.

**Monitor and iterate**
Check workflow execution history and refine based on real performance.

**Use integrations**
Reference tools with `@gmail`, `@slack`, `@clickup` to connect workflows to your systems.

## When to Use Workflows

Use workflows for:
- **Recurring tasks** — Daily summaries, weekly reports, monthly cleanups
- **Event responses** — Auto-reply to emails, notify on form submissions
- **Data syncing** — Keep systems in sync automatically
- **Scheduled actions** — Send reminders, generate reports, run backups

Don't use workflows for:
- One-off tasks (just ask Kafka directly)
- Complex decision-making requiring human judgment
- Tasks that need real-time human collaboration (use Playbooks instead)
